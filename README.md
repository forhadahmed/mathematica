Web Application Interface for Mathematica
=========================================

A simple clean **web-interface** for a local install of the **Mathematica** kernel.
This is *not* meant as a replacement for Mathematica's rich Notebook interface but 
rather, a simple interface for that *quick computation* that is required when you
(or your colleagues) are offsite and all you have is a browser.

Pre-requisites:

* **Mathematica** installed on a **Linux** machine (Support for other OS'es forthcoming!)
* Web-server running PHP
