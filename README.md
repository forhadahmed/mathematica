Web Application Interface for Mathematica
=========================================

A simple clean web-interface for a local install of the Mathematica kernel.
This is not meant as a replacement for Mathematica's rich Notebook interface
but rather, a simple interface for that quick computation that is required
when you are off-site.

Assumptions are:

* Mathematica installed on a Linux machine
* Web-server running PHP
